PROJECT: SVM (Support Vector Machines) for Cancer Cell Detection

DATASET:
The dataset is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Asuncion and Newman, 2007)[http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRepository.html]. 
The dataset consists of several hundred human cell sample records, each of which contains the values of a set of cell characteristics.

ABOUT SVM Model:
SVM maps data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not linearly separable. 
A separator between the categories is found, then the data are transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane.
